#As mentioned in this problem, 2-Node Kubernetes cluster is broken! 
#we need to troubleshoot, fix the cluster issues and then deploy the 
#objects according to the given architecture diagram to unlock our 
#Image Gallery!!

#First, we are not being able to communicate with kubernetes cluster 
#using client kubectl due to wrong server port.As such our first job
#will be changing the current server port in the config file using sed
#
#Now,let's check the current port
cat /root/.kube/config | grep server
#We will get the following out after running above command
server: https://controlplane:6433
#Now, let's change the port
sed -i 's/6333/6443/g' /root/.kube/config

#Second, we need to update the static pod of the kube-apiserver as the
#file referenced by the --client-ca-file argument to the API server 
#doesn't exist.We need to edit the API server manifest(static pod) 
#and correct this.

vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml

#Once, kubectl able to communicate with kubernetes cluster we need to
#edit coredns deployment image as mentioned in the problem.

kubectl edit deployment coredns -n kube-system

# Lastly, we need to uncordon the disabled worker node as mentioned in the
# problem.

kubectl uncordon node01
