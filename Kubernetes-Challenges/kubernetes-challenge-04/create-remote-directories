# Since building redis cluster involve stateful application, we need to create 
# directories on remote host for each persisent volume and each instances of 
# stateful application

#First check the available worker node in kubernetes cluster

kubectl get nodes -o wide

#We have node01 as working node.As such, we need to access worker node

ssh node01

# Within node01 we have to create six working directories 

for i in $(seq 1 6) ; do mkdir -p "/redis0$i"; done

# verify working directories in worker node

ls -ld /redis*

# exit the worker node with "exit" command
