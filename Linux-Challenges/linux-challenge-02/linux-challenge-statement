  Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for the GoApp so that we can access the GoApp on port "80
  Start and Enable "nginx" service.
  Start GoApp by running the "nohup go run main.go &" command from "/home/bob/go-app/" directory, it can take few seconds to start.
  Install "nginx" package.
  Install "firewalld" package.
  Troubleshoot the issues with "yum/dnf" and make sure you are able to install the packages on "centos-host"
  Start and Enable "firewalld" service
  Add firewall rules to allow only incoming port "22", "80" and "8081".
  The firewall rules must be permanent and effective immediately.
