# Question: Some new developers have joined our team, so we need to create some users/groups and further need to setup some permissions and access rights for them.
#
#
# Challenge details:

  Create a group called "devs"
  Create a user called "ray" , change his login shell to "/bin/sh" and set "D3vU3r321" password for this user.
  Make user "ray" a member of "devs" group.
  Create a user called "lisa", change her login shell to "/bin/sh" and set "D3vUd3r123" password for this user.
  Make user "lisa" a member of "devs" group.
  Make sure all users under "devs" group can only run the "dnf" command with "sudo" and without entering any password.
· Edit the disk quota for the group called "devs". Limit the amount of storage space it can use (not inodes). Set a "soft" limit of "100MB" and a "hard" limit of "500MB" on "/data" partition.
· Configure a "resource limit" for the "devs" group so that this group (members of the group) can not run more than "30 processes" in their session. This should be both a "hard limit" and a "soft limit", written in a single line.
  Create a group called "admins"
  Create a user called "david" , change his login shell to "/bin/zsh" and set "D3vUd3raaw" password for this user.
  Make user "david" a member of "admins" group.
  Create a user called "natasha" , change her login shell to "/bin/zsh" and set "DwfawUd113" password for this user.
  Make user "natasha" a member of "admins" group.
  Give some additional permissions to "admins" group on "/data" directory so that any user who is the member the "admins" group has "full permissions" on this directory.
  Make sure "/data" directory is owned by user "bob" and group "devs" and "user/group" owner has "full" permissions but "other" should not have any permissions.
  Make sure "/data" directory is owned by user "bob".
