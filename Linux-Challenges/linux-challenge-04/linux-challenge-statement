# Question: Some of our apps generate some raw data and store the same in /home/bob/preserved directory. We want to clean and manipulate some data and then want to create an archive of that data.

# Challenge details:

  Create "/opt/appdata" directory.
  Find the "hidden" files in "/home/bob/preserved" directory and copy them in "/opt/appdata/hidden/" directory (create the destination directory if doesn't exist).
  Find the "non-hidden" files in "/home/bob/preserved" directory and copy them in "/opt/appdata/files/" directory (create the destination directory if doesn't exist).
  Find and delete the files in "/opt/appdata" directory that contain a word ending with the letter "t" (case sensitive).
  Change all the occurrences of the word "yes" to "no" in all files present under "/opt/appdata/" directory.
  Change all the occurrences of the word "raw" to "processed" in all files present under "/opt/appdata/" directory. It must be a "case-insensitive" replacement, means all words must be replaced like "raw , Raw , RAW" etc.
  Create a script called "/home/bob/filter.sh".
  Create a "softlink" called "/home/bob/appdata.tar.gz" of "/opt/appdata.tar.gz" file.
  Create a "tar.gz" archive of "/opt/appdata" directory and save the archive to this file: "/opt/appdata.tar.gz"
  The "appdata.tar.gz" archive should have the final processed data.
  Add the "sticky bit" special permission on "/opt/appdata" directory (keep the other permissions as it is).
  Make "bob" the "user" and the "group" owner of "/opt/appdata.tar.gz" file.
  The "user/group" owner should have "read only" permissions on "/opt/appdata.tar.gz" file and "others" should not have any permissions.
