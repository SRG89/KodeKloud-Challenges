# Question : For this challenge we wll create a cron job script to start & stop Docker container

# Challenge details:
  
  Create a bash script called "container-stop.sh" under "/home/bob/" which should be able to stop the "myapp" container. It should also display a message "myapp container stopped!"
  Add a cron job for the "root" user which should run "container-stop.sh" script at "12am" everyday.
  Add a cron job for the "root" user which should run "container-start.sh" script at "8am" everyday.
  Create a bash script called "container-start.sh" under "/home/bob/" which should be able to "start" the "myapp" container. It should also display a message "myapp container started!"
  The "root" account is currently locked on "centos-host", please unlock it.
  Make user "root" a member of "wheel" group
  Add a local DNS entry for the database hostname "mydb.kodekloud.com" so that it can resolve to "10.0.0.50" IP address.
  Set a password for mysql root user to "S3cure#321"
  Install "mariadb" database server on this server and "start/enable" its service.
  Add an extra IP to "eth1" interface on this system: 10.0.0.50/24
  Pull "nginx" docker image.
  Create and run a new Docker container based on the "nginx" image. The container should be named as "myapp" and the port "80" on the host should be mapped to the port "80" on the container.
  Edit the PAM configuration file for the "su" utility so that this utility only accepts the requests from the users that are part of the "wheel" group and the requests from the users 
  should be accepted immediately, without asking for any password.
