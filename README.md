# KodeKloud-Challenges
-------------------------------------------
This repository consists of challenge series for three fundamental devops tools used for various tasks including but not limited to system administration, container orchestration, automation and infrastructure provisioning.
Below is the summary of each tools included in this challenge series.

Linux
-----------------------

The linux challenge series is a set of hands-on challenges designed to test the mastery of Linux concepts.These challenges will test on a wide variety of Linux concepts, often combining several areas of study into a single challenge 
that reflects not only performance-based Linux exams, but also the real-world challenges that Linux administrators encounter in their daily work.

Tasks included but not limited to:

1. Disk partitioning and Linux filesystem management
2. User and group management
3. File search and manipulation
4. Permissions and fundamental security concepts
5. Process management
6. Package management
7. Service configuration (http, databases, proxy)
8. Container and Virtual Machine management
9. Networking, route management, and packet filtering

Solution for each challenge is provided in single script file while details related to the challenge are included in problem statement file.

Kubernetes
------------------------------------

Likewise, the kubernetes challenge series is a set of hands-on challenges designed to test the mastery of container orchestration concepts.These challenges will test on a wide variety of Kubernetes concepts such as 
to deploy new applications to a cluster, troubleshooting existing applications, troubleshooting and fixing security and network related issues within the cluster, and many more.

Tasks included but not limited to:

1. Deploy new applications to a cluster
2. Troubleshoot existing applications
3. Learn Kubernetes security concepts and best practices
4. Debug Kubernetes clusters and applications
5. Deploying and scaling stateful applications

Terraform
------------------------------------------
Similarly, the terraform series consists of a set of hands-on challenges designed to test the mastering of provisioning and managing infrastructure using terraform. For this challenge series, we
start off with deploying a simple webapp on an existing Kubernetes cluster and then move on to more complicated challenges involving provisioning resources and entire infrastructure stacks in the AWS cloud.

Tasks included but not limited to:

1. Terraform code to create and modify resources
2. Provision Remote backends to store and collaborate
3. Troubleshoot and debug Terraform code
