# Question: Welcome to the terraform challenge series.

# In this challenge we will implement a simple LAMP stack using terraform and docker.
# Utilize /root/code/terraform-challenges/challenge2 directory to store your Terraform configuration files.

# Inspect the requirements in detail by clicking on the icons of the interactive architecture diagram on the right and complete the tasks. 
# Once done click on the Check button to validate your work.

# 1. Install terraform binary version=1.1.5 on iac-server

# 2. Docker provider has already been configured using kreuzwerker/docker provider.
     
     Check out the provider.tf given at /root/code/terraform-challenges/challenge2

# 3. Create a terraform resource named php-httpd-image for building docker image with following specifications:
     
     Image name: php-httpd:challenge
     Build context: lamp_stack/php_httpd
     Labels: challenge: second

# 4. Create a terraform resource named mariadb-image for building docker image with following specifications:

     Image name: mariadb:challenge
     Build context: lamp_stack/custom_db
     Labels: challenge: second

# 5. Define a terraform resource phpmyadmin for docker container with following configurations:

     Container Name: db_dashboard
     Image Used: phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin
     Hostname: phpmyadmin
     Attach the container to network my_network
     Publish a container's port(s) to the host:
     Hostport: 0.0.0.0:8081
     containerPort: 80
     Labels: challenge: second
     Establish link based connectivity between db and db_dashboard containers (Deprecated)
     Explicitly specify a dependency on mariadb terraform resource

# 6. Create a terraform resource named mariadb_volume creating a docker volume with name=mariadb-volume
